# Terraform Cheat Sheet

 
Creating a cheat sheet of 100 commands for Terraform would be quite extensive and perhaps overwhelming. Instead, I'll provide you with a categorised cheat sheet of the most important commands. However, if you require additional or specific commands, feel free to ask.

# Terraform Command Cheat Sheet 

## Initialization 

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform init`| This command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It's safe to run this command multiple times.|

## Planning 

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform plan`| This command creates an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.|
|`terraform plan -out=path`| This command writes the plan to the given path. This can be used as input to the "apply" command.|
|`terraform plan -destroy`| This is used when the plan should be created to destroy all resources.|

## Applying 

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform apply`| This command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a `terraform plan` execution plan.|
|`terraform apply -auto-approve`| This skips interactive approval before applying the plan.|

## Destroy 

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform destroy`| This command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.|

## Other Commands 

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform get`| This command downloads and updates modules mentioned in the root module.|
|`terraform fmt`| This command is used to rewrite Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style.|
|`terraform validate`| This command validates the Terraform configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.|
|`terraform console`| This command provides an interactive console for evaluating expressions.|
|`terraform graph`| This command is used to generate a visual representation of either a configuration or execution plan.|
|`terraform import`| This command is used to import existing infrastructure into your Terraform state.|
|`terraform output`| This command is used to extract the value of an output variable from the Terraform state.|
|`terraform refresh`| This command is used to update the Terraform state file with real-world resources.|
|`terraform state`| This command is used for advanced state management.|
|`terraform taint`| This command manually marks a Terraform-managed resource as tainted, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated on the next apply.|
|`terraform untaint`| This command manually unmarks a Terraform-managed resource as tainted.|
|`terraform workspace`| This command is used for workspace management. Workspace allow you to maintain separate state files for the same configuration providing a simple way to create environments (e.g. dev, staging, prod).|

Sure! Here are more commands that could be helpful to use with Terraform.

## Terraform Variables and Output

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform apply -var 'variable=value'`| Allows you to set a variable directly from the command line.|
|`terraform apply -var-file=foo`| Use this command to provide a variable file to Terraform.|
|`terraform output -json`| To view the output in a JSON format.|

## Terraform State Management 

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform state list`| This command lists resources within a Terraform state.|
|`terraform state show [resource_name]`| This command shows the details of a specific resource in the Terraform state.|
|`terraform state mv [source] [destination]`| This command is used to move items in the state.|
|`terraform state rm [resource_name]`| This command is used to remove items from the Terraform state file.|
|`terraform state pull`| This command is used to manually download and output the state from remote state.|
|`terraform state push`| This command is used to manually upload a local state file to remote state.|

## Terraform Workspace

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform workspace new [workspace]`| This command is used to create a new workspace.|
|`terraform workspace select [workspace]`| This command is used to switch between different workspaces.|
|`terraform workspace list`| This command is used to list out all the workspaces.|
|`terraform workspace show`| This command is used to display the current workspace.|
|`terraform workspace delete [workspace]`| This command is used to delete a workspace.|

## Terraform Import

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform import [arguments] [address]`| This command is used to import existing infrastructure into Terraform.|

Absolutely! Continuing with more commands, especially focusing on modules and providers.

## Terraform Module and Providers 

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform providers`| This command is used to print a tree of the providers used in the configuration.|
|`terraform providers schema -json`| This command is used to output the JSON representation of the schemas for the providers used in the configuration.|
|`terraform providers mirror [directory]`| This command is used to mirror the providers used in the configuration to a local directory.|

## Terraform Debugging and Troubleshooting

|--|--|
|`TF_LOG=TRACE terraform apply`| This is used to debug the Terraform application. You can replace `TRACE` with `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR` to change the verbosity of the logs.|
|`TF_LOG_PATH=path/to/logfile terraform apply`| This command is used to store the debug log in a file instead of printing it in the console.|

## Terraform Format and Validation

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform fmt -check`| This command is used to check if files are correctly formatted. It will not rewrite the files.|
|`terraform fmt -diff`| This command will display a diff of format changes.|
|`terraform validate -json`| This command will validate the configuration and output the results in JSON format.|

## Terraform Cloud

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform login`| This command is used to obtain and save an API token for Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise.|
|`terraform logout`| This command removes locally-stored credentials for Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise.|

## Terraform Misc Commands

|Command|Explanation|
|--|--|
|`terraform version`| This command is used to print the Terraform version.|
|`terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID [DIR]`| This command manually unlocks the state for the defined configuration. This will not modify your infrastructure.|
|`terraform 0.12upgrade`| This command is used to upgrade Terraform syntax to the 0.12 version.|
|`terraform -install-autocomplete`| This command installs the shell autocomplete feature.|

These additional commands should provide a more holistic view of Terraform's capabilities. As always, consult the [official documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/index.html) for the most accurate information.
